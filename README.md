#Reproducing the 1 Thousand Plant Transcriptome Study

The purpose of this study is to reproduce "One thousand plant transcriptomes and the phylogenomics of green plants" using a small subset of the genes used in the original study to gain a better understanding of the phylogenomic pipeline. To contribute to the study, I will use two different alignment methods and compare the results of each to that of the original study. All data and background on the study can be found at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1693-2.

**data** contains all gene transcriptomes sourced from those freely available from the original study and the output of all manipulations performed throughout my own study.
**figures** contains the phylogenetic trees produced in this study
**manuscript** contains the written report on my methods and findings
**scripts** contains the reproducible scripts for the study and all in-class activities
