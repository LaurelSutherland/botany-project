# Reproducing "One Thousand Plant Transcriptomes" Study With Gene Subset
========================================================================

###Dataset
Data will include a subset of the genes from the original “One thousand plant transcriptomes and the phylogenomics of green plants” study (2019) https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1693-2 to create a gene tree of the species included in this study to examine the predicted evolutionary history of these major clades. 
Data is currently composed of pre-aligned transcriptomes for each gene listed by species in their own FASTA file. There are 410 subsets (genes) within the original dataset and I expect to select a smaller dataset of genes from this original set to formulate a more manageable project for this class.
